A slightly garbage music program made out of boredom, idiocy, and
needing to take a programming class. Write your song using a notation I can't
even fully explain, and also if you don't use the notation right? You get an unhandled reference exception.
Don't worry though, there is a built in song incase you put in empty things for the console inputs.
